Some southerners like to gripe that it’s because the region wasn’t given a fair chance after the Civil War and during Reconstruction. And there have been a lot of studies about how the south is decades behind the rest of the country. Small multiple maps that rank the states (plus DC) from 1-51 in a bunch of different categories (need to think about how to choose categories). Aggregate rankings of states from those categories. Can I say the South is X years behind in X category? Slope charts showing the change over time by metric - is the South catching up?",

ShowTime plans to launch the reboot of the L Word by the end of the year, which is a HUGE cultural touchstone for just about every queer woman my age (admittedly, Sarah hasn’t seen it). One of the most meme-able things from the show was “the chart,” a hand drawn network diagram of who was dating who. The chart even turned into a social networking site called ourchart.com. The idea would be to rewatch every episode and plot the connections. I have a good friend, Alissa Scheller, who does data viz at Pew who wants in on this project. I’m thinking it would be similar to the LA Times’ Sex in the City dating table with some small networks or some other combination of the two approaches. One of the main characters, Shane, was a legendary womanizer, so it could rate the characters on how “Shane” they are.",
